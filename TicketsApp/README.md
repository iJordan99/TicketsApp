# **TicketsApp**

> A cross-platform ticket management application built with .NET MAUI.

## **Overview**

TicketsApp is a modern, lightweight, and cross-platform application designed to streamline ticket management workflows.
The app allows users to view, create, and manage tickets efficiently by integrating essential features such as API error
handling, customizable parsing configurations, and robust MVVM architecture.

This project utilizes **.NET MAUI** to deliver a rich user experience across **iOS**, **Android**, and **MacCatalyst**,
ensuring seamless functionality across multiple device platforms.

---

## **Features**

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on iOS, Android, and MacOS using .NET MAUI.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Implements the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern for maintainable and testable code.
- **Ticket Parsing**: Includes a flexible parsing system (`TicketParser.cs`) for extracting ticket data from API
  responses with optional includes (e.g., engineers, comments, author).
- **Error Management**: Handles API errors gracefully with `ApiErrorResponse` and extensible error parsing interfaces (
  `IErrorParser.cs`).
- **Global Configuration**: Centralized parsing configurations via `GlobalParsingConfig.cs` to simplify mappings of API
  response fields.
- **Highly Commented Code**: Includes XML-based code documentation for enhanced readability and quick understanding of
  logic.
- **MAUI-Specific Capabilities**: Takes advantage of .NET MAUI features like `Shell`, `RelayCommand` attributes, and
  observable properties.

## **Technologies Used**

- **.NET MAUI**: Cross-platform UI framework.
- **C# 13.0**: For its modern syntax and pattern matching features.
- **.NET 9.0**: The latest version of the .NET platform.
- **MVVM Toolkit**: For implementing MVVM features like `RelayCommand`, `ObservableProperty`, etc.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**

- **Visual Studio** (2022 or later) with the **.NET MAUI workload** installed.
- .NET 9.0 SDK

### **Steps to Get Started**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TicketsApp.git
   cd TicketsApp
   ```

2. **Restore Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all required NuGet packages:
   ```
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Build and Run**:
   On your desired platform:
   ```
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

4. **Configure API Integration**:
    - Update the `AppSettings.json` file (or equivalent configurations) with your API base URL and credentials to
      connect to the backend.

## **Key Components**

### **1. Ticket Parsing with `TicketParser`**

- The `TicketParser` class carries out complex parsing operations for ticket lists and details. It incorporates:
    - Mapping engineers, comments, and authors using constants.
    - Guard clauses for clean and safe parsing.
    - Modular functions to extract optional includes like engineers or comments.

### **2. API Error Management**

- Unified error-handling logic via `IErrorParser`, and errors are encapsulated in `ApiErrorResponse`.
- Example:
   ```csharp
   var result = await errorParser.Parse(response);
   if (!result.Success)
       Console.WriteLine(result.Error?.Errors);
   ```

### **3. MVVM Toolkit Integration**

- Simplifies property binding using attributes like `[ObservableProperty]`.
- Use of `RelayCommand` for straightforward command implementation.
